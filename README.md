# VBA-challenge
VBA Assignment
The project contains 3 screenshots, one for each sheet in the Workbook with the results produced by the VBA script I created; and a VBA script file that contains the code.
The script runs a loop through each sheet (each year), analysing the the data and outputting the required information into the new created columns.
